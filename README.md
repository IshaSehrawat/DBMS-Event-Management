# DBMS-Event-Management
We intend to design an application for event management in the different fests conducted in a college. It will help in the easy and effective coordination of all the units functioning to make a fest successful. Various students categorized under the organizing committee and organizing team coordinate to ensure itâ€™s smooth running. Various activities are conducted throughout the day, followed by a star performance at night. Different students from other schools/colleges come to attend it. It takes a lot of time and effort to conduct a fest. This system aims to reduce effort and save time and ensure smooth functioning of the same by efficiently maintaining and storing data, which can be viewed by the people involved in the fest according to their needs.
